# Selection

Many [collection components](collections.html) support selecting items by clicking or tapping them, or by using the keyboard.
This page discusses how to handle selection events, how to control selection programmatically, and the
data structures used to represent a selection.

## Multiple selection

Selection is handled by the `onSelectionChange` event, which is supported on most collection components. Controlled
behavior is supported by the `selectedKeys` prop, and uncontrolled behavior is supported by the `defaultSelectedKeys`
prop. These props are passed to the top-level collection component, and accept a set of unique item keys that are selected.
This allows marking items as selected by their key even before they are loaded, which can be useful when you know
what items should be selected on initial render, before data loading has completed.

Selection is represented by a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
object. You can also pass any iterable collection (e.g. an array) to the `selectedKeys` and `defaultSelectedKeys` props,
but the `onSelectionChange` event will always pass back a Set.

Selection is supported on both [static](collections.html#static-collections) and [dynamic](collections.html#dynamic-collections)
collections. The following example shows how to implement controlled selection
behavior on a static collection, but could be applied to a dynamic collection the same way.

```tsx
let [selectedKeys, setSelectedKeys] = useState(new Set());

<ListBox selectedKeys={selectedKeys} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKeys}>
  <Item key="one">One</Item>
  <Item key="two">Two</Item>
  <Item key="three">Three</Item>
</ListBox>
```

## Single selection

So far, we've discussed multiple selection. However, you may wish to limit selection to a single item instead.
In some components, like a select or combo box, only single selection is supported. In this case, the singular
`selectedKey` and `defaultSelectedKey` props are available instead of their plural variants. These accept a
single key instead of a Set as their value, and `onSelectionChange` is also called with a single key.

```tsx
let [selectedKey, setSelectedKey] = useState(null);

<ComboBox selectedKey={selectedKey} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKey}>
  <Item key="one">One</Item>
  <Item key="two">Two</Item>
  <Item key="three">Three</Item>
</ComboBox>
```

In components which support multiple selection, you can limit the selection to a single item using the
`selectionMode` prop. This continues to accept `selectedKeys` and `defaultSelectedKeys` as a Set, but it will
only contain a single key at a time.

```tsx
let [selectedKeys, setSelectedKeys] = useState(new Set());

<ListBox
  selectionMode="single"
  selectedKeys={selectedKeys}
  onSelectionChange={setSelectedKeys}>
  <Item key="one">One</Item>
  <Item key="two">Two</Item>
  <Item key="three">Three</Item>
</ListBox>
```

## Selected key data type

As mentioned in the collection [docs](./collections.html#unique-keys), there are two ways that keys can be defined for your collection items.
The method you use will affect the data type you provide to your `defaultSelectedKey(s)` and `selectedKey(s)` props and what `onSelectionChange` returns.

If you directly specify the key on each `Item` using the `key` prop, `defaultSelectedKey(s)`/`selectedKey(s)` will expect a string/list of strings regardless of the
original data type provided to the `Item`'s `key` prop. As seen in the example below, the `selectedKey` is initialized to `"2"` rather than `2` despite the fact that
the `dataIds` provided to each `Item` `key` are numbers.

```tsx
let items = [
  {name: 'Aardvark', dataId: 1},
  {name: 'Kangaroo', dataId: 2},
  {name: 'Snake', dataId: 3}
];

let [selectedKey, setSelectedKey] = useState("2");
<ComboBox selectedKey={selectedKey} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKey}>
  {item => <Item key={item.dataId}>{item.name}</Item>}
</ComboBox>
```

If you specify a `key` or `id` within your `items` array and forgo specifying a key on the `Item` instead, `defaultSelectedKey(s)`/`selectedKey(s)` should match the data type
of the `key` or `id`. As seen in the example below, the `selectedKey` is initialized as a `number`, matching the `key` type of the `items` array.

```tsx
let items = [
  {name: 'Aardvark', key: 1},
  {name: 'Kangaroo', key: 2},
  {name: 'Snake', key: 3}
];

let [selectedKey, setSelectedKey] = useState(2);
<ComboBox selectedKey={selectedKey} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKey}>
  {item => <Item>{item.name}</Item>}
</ComboBox>
```

## Dynamic data

When data in a collection changes, the selection state may need to be updated accordingly. For example, if a selected item is
deleted, it should be removed from the set of selected keys. You can do this yourself, but the <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useListData} />
and <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useTreeData} /> hooks can handle this automatically.

```tsx
let list = useListData({
  initialItems: [
    {name: 'Aardvark'},
    {name: 'Kangaroo'},
    {name: 'Snake'}
  ],
  initialSelectedKeys: ['Kangaroo'],
  getKey: item => item.name
});

function removeItem() {
  // Removing the list item will also remove it from the selection state.
  list.remove('Kangaroo');
}

<ListBox
  items={list.items}
  selectedKeys={list.selectedKeys}
  onSelectionChange={list.setSelectedKeys}>
  {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
</ListBox>
```

For more information, see [useListData](useListData.html) and [useTreeData](useTreeData.html).

## Select All

Some components support a checkbox to select all items in the collection, or a keyboard shortcut like <Keyboard>âŒ˜ Cmd</Keyboard> + <Keyboard>A</Keyboard>.
This represents a selection of all items in the collection, regardless of whether or not all items have been loaded from the network.
For example, when using a component with infinite scrolling support, the user will be unaware that all items are not yet loaded because
it loads more transparently to them as they scroll down. For this reason, it makes sense for select all to represent all items, not just
the loaded ones.

When a select all event occurs, `onSelectionChange` is called with the string `"all"` rather than a set of selected keys. `selectedKeys`
and `defaultSelectedKeys` can also be set to `"all"` to programmatically select all items. This represents all items in the collection,
whether currently loaded or not. The application must adjust its handling of bulk actions in this case to apply to the entire collection
rather than only the keys available to it locally.

```tsx
let [selectedKeys, setSelectedKeys] = useState(new Set());

function performBulkAction() {
  if (selectedKeys === 'all') {
    // perform action on all items
  } else {
    // perform action on selected items in selectedKeys
  }
}

<ListBox
  items={items}
  selectedKeys={selectedKeys}
  onSelectionChange={setSelectedKeys}>
  {item => <Item>{item.name}</Item>}
</ListBox>
```
