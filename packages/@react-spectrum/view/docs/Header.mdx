# Header

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Header.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Header']} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Header>Cute cats</Header>
```

## Content

The `Header` component represents a header within a Spectrum container
such as a [Dialog](Dialog.html). `Header` provides no specific styling by
itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition,
`Header` will be automatically placed within the container's layout
according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Dialog](Dialog.html#examples) for examples of how to use the
`Header` component in the context of a Spectrum container.
See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) for more
information about the semantics of the `header` element.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Header} links={docs.links} />
