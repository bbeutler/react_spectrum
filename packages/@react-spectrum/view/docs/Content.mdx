<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Content.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo

  componentNames={['Content']} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Content>Content is king</Content>
```

## Content

The `Content` component represents the primary content within a Spectrum container
such as a [Dialog](Dialog.html) or [IllustratedMessage](IllustratedMessage.html).
`Content` provides no specific styling by itself, but receives styling from the
parent container. In addition, `Content` will be automatically placed within the
container's layout according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Dialog](Dialog.html#example) and [IllustratedMessage](IllustratedMessage.html#example)
for examples of how to use the `Content` component in the context of a Spectrum container.
See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) for more
information about the semantics of the `section` element, which is used internally
by the `Content` component.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Content} links={docs.links} />
