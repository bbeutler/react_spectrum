# Footer

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Footer.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo

  componentNames={['Footer']} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Footer>&copy; All rights reserved.</Footer>
```

## Content

The `Footer` component represents a footer within a Spectrum container
such as a [Dialog](Dialog.html). `Footer` provides no specific styling by
itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition,
`Footer` will be automatically placed within the container's layout
according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Dialog](Dialog.html#examples) for examples of how to use the
`Footer` component in the context of a Spectrum container.
See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)
for more information about the semantics of the `footer` element.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Footer} links={docs.links} />
