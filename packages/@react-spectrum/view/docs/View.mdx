## Introduction

The `View` component can be used as a general purpose container element, similar to a
`div`. It supports Spectrum style props, which enable you to use Spectrum variables for
styling to ensure consistency with other Spectrum components. In addition, Spectrum
variables automatically adapt to color scheme changes (e.g. dark mode), and platform
scale (e.g. touch vs. mouse input). See [Styling](styling.html) to learn more.

## Example

The following example shows how you might build a container element using Spectrum defined
variables for the border and padding. Use the color scheme and scale pickers to see how the
view changes automatically based on these variables.

```tsx example themeSwitcher=true
<View
  borderWidth="thin"
  borderColor="dark"
  borderRadius="medium"
  padding="size-250">
  <TextField label="Name" />
</View>
```

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.View} links={docs.links} />
