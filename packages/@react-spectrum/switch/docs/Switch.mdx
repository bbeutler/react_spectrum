# Switch

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Switch.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Switch']}
  sourceData={[
    {type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/switch/'}
  ]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Switch>Low power mode</Switch>

```

## Content

Switches accept children, which are rendered as the label.

Switches are best used for communicating activation (e.g. on/off states), while [checkboxes](./Checkbox.html) are best used for communicating selection (e.g. multiple table rows).
Switches, unlike checkboxes, can't have an error state.

### Accessibility

In certain cases a visible label isn't needed. For example, a Switch located at the top of a panel which toggles the panels options on or off.
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided to the Switch for accessibility.
If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the id of the labeling element instead.

```tsx example
<Switch aria-label="Low power mode" />
```

### Internationalization

To internationalize a Switch, a localized label should be passed to the `children` or `aria-label` prop.
For languages that are read right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew and Arabic), the layout of the switch is automatically flipped.

## Value

Switches are not selected by default. The `defaultSelected` prop can be used to set the default state (uncontrolled).
Alternatively, the `isSelected` prop can be used to make the selected state controlled.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [selected, setSelection] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Switch
        defaultSelected>
        Low power mode (uncontrolled)
      </Switch>

      <Switch
        isSelected={selected}
        onChange={setSelection}>
        Low power mode (controlled)
      </Switch>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Events

Switches accept a user defined `onChange` prop, triggered whenever the Switch is pressed.
The example below uses `onChange` to alert the user to changes in state.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [selected, setSelection] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Switch onChange={setSelection}>
        Switch Label
      </Switch>
      <div>The Switch is on: {selected.toString()}</div>
    </>
  );
 }
```

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Switch} links={docs.links} />
