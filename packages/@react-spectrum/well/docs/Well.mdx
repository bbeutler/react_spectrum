# Well

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Well.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Well']} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Well>Better a little which is well done, than a great deal imperfectly.</Well>
```

## Content

Wells accept any renderable children.

```tsx example
<Well>Well, well, well</Well>

```

### Internationalization

In order to internationalize a well, a localized string should be passed to the `children` prop.

### Accessibility

By default, the visual separation of a Well is not conveyed to assistive technologies. As such it should be used where this separation makes no difference in understanding the content.

However, if the Well does convey semantic meaning then a role must be specified and, if appropriate, labeled using either aria-label or aria-labelledby.

```tsx example
<Well role="region" aria-labelledby="wellLabel">
  <h3 id="wellLabel">Shipping Address</h3>
  <p>601 Townsend Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94103</p>
</Well>
```

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Well} links={docs.links} />
