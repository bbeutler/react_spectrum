# Link

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Link.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Link']}
  sourceData={[{type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/link/'}]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Link><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6348138/" target="_blank">The missing link.</a></Link>
```

## Content

Links accept content as children.
If the child is a native anchor element, or a link component used with a client side router, the Link component will add spectrum styles and event handlers to that element.
Actual navigation will be handled by the wrapped element.

```tsx example
<Link><a href="https://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe.com</a></Link>
```

To use in [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

```tsx
import {Link} from '@react-spectrum/link';
import {Link as RouterLink} from 'react-router-dom';

<Link><RouterLink to="/next-page">Next Page</RouterLink></Link>
```

If the content is plain text, it will be styled and exposed to assistive technologies as a link.
Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.
Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in new tab will not apply.

```tsx example
<Link onPress={() => alert('pressed!')}>A label</Link>
```


### Internationalization

In order to internationalize a link, a localized string should be passed to the `children` prop.

### Accessibility

For string-typed `children`, the link component will expose the accessible role to assistive technology as a "link".

```tsx example
<Link onPress={e => alert(`clicked "${e.target.textContent}" Link`)}>
  I forgot my password
</Link>
```

For other children, use an element of semantic meaning, or use a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) where appropriate.

Be mindful of what the experience is for users navigating with screen readers. Make sure to give enough context about where the link will take the user.
