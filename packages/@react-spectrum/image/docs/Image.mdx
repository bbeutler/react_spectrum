# Image

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.Image.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Image']} />

## Examples

```tsx example
<Image src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7AzH2c.png" alt="Sky and roof" />
```

## Content

The `Image` component represents an image within a Spectrum container
such as a [Dialog](Dialog.html). `Image` provides no specific styling
by itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition,
`Image` will be automatically placed within the container's layout
according to Spectrum guidelines.

**Note: Images must have an `alt` attribute.** If the image is
considered decorative and should not be announced by screen readers,
then set `alt=""` to suppress the warning.

See [Dialog](Dialog.html#examples) for examples of how to use the
`Image` component in the context of a Spectrum container.

### Internationalization

To internationalize an `Image`, a localized string should be passed to the `alt` prop.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Image} links={docs.links} />

## Visual options

### Decorative

```tsx example
<Flex width="200px">
  <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/c3gTKSJ.jpg" alt="" />
</Flex>
```

### Object Fit

```tsx example
<Flex width="100%" height="200px">
  <Image
    src="https://i.imgur.com/c3gTKSJ.jpg"
    alt="Eiffel Tower at sunset"
    objectFit="cover" />
</Flex>
```
