# Architecture

This page discusses the architecture of React Spectrum, and how
behavior and core logic for many common components can be shared
between design systems and across platforms.

## Introduction

Today, many companies are implementing their own component libraries for their
design systems from scratch. On the web, the primitives are very low level.
There are very few built-in browser controls that are fully styleable, so
each company needs to reimplement many of the same components from scratch.
This has become easier to do with React and other modern view libraries, but
implementing full support for accessibility, internationalization, keyboard,
mouse, and touch interactions, and other features is still extraordinarily
difficult.

In addition, JavaScript has spread beyond only the web platform. Platforms
like React Native allow React to render native widgets across mobile
and desktop operating systems as well. This will continue to expand in the
future as new platforms and interaction models are developed.

While each design system is unique, there is often more in common between
components than different. Most components typically found in a design
system, like buttons, checkboxes, selects, and even
tables, usually have very similar behavior and logic. There are even
specifications that describe how many of the most common components should
behave in terms of [accessibility semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)
and [keyboard interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).
The main difference between design systems is the styling.

This opens up to the possibility of sharing much of the behavior and
component logic between design systems and across platforms. For example,
user interactions, accessibility, internationalization, and behavior
can be reused, while allowing custom styling and rendering to live
within individual design systems. This has the potential to improve
the overall quality of applications, while saving companies money
and time, and reducing duplicated effort across the industry.

In order to allow reusing component behavior between design systems,
React Spectrum splits each component into three parts: state, behavior,
and the rendered component.

Some components don't have all of these pieces. For example, some simple
components do not require any state, and others are only compositions of
other components, so each component has the pieces of this architecture
that make sense for their purpose.

This architecture is made possible by
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), which enable
the ability to reuse behavior between multiple components. Hooks allow
accessing React features like state and effects from functions which
can be called from any component. If you're unfamiliar with hooks,
we recommend reading the documentation linked above first.

### State hook

At the bottom is the state hook. This hook is shared across platforms —
it could work on the web, react-native, or any other platform, and makes
no assumptions about the view system it is running on. It also has no
theme or design system specific logic.

The state hook accepts common props from the component and provides
state management. It implements the core logic for the component and
returns an interface for reading and updating the component state.

Not all components have a state hook. For example, many components are
read-only — they display something to the user but don't allow them
to change it. State hooks are found in interactive components that allow
data entry, or have some kind of visual state that the user can update
(e.g. expanding/collapsing).

### Behavior hook

In the middle is the behavior hook. This hook is platform specific, and
depends on the platform API (e.g. the DOM or react-native). It also has
no theme or design system specific logic. It implements event
handling, accessibility, internationalization, etc. — all the parts of a
component that could be shared across multiple design systems.

The behavior hook uses the state hook in order to implement component behavior.
It returns one or more sets of platform specific props (e.g. DOM props) that
can be spread onto the elements rendered by the component. These include
semantic properties like [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), and
event handlers. The event handlers in turn call methods on
the state interface to implement the behavior for the component.

Some components may not have any user interactions, but still have a behavior
hook. Most components have some kind of semantics that they need to expose
for accessibility (a form of behavior). The only components that won't have
a behavior hook of their own are those that only compose together other
components.

### Component

At the top is the component, which lives in each design system and composes
all of these pieces together. It provides the theme and design system specific
logic, and renders the actual platform elements. It applies styles, which could
be implemented in many different ways (e.g. CSS classes, CSS-in-JS, etc.).

The component uses props returned by the behavior hook and state from the state
hook to implement the visual appearance. It spreads props returned from the behavior
hook onto elements that it renders to apply semantics and interactions, and can use
the state from the state hook to adjust its visual appearance.
This allows complete control over the rendering of the component, including
things like adding extra elements as needed for styling or layout control.

## Implementation

<figure className={style.float}>
  <Flex direction="column" gap="size-125">
    <View backgroundColor="magenta-600" height="size-900">
      <Flex alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" height="100%">
        <span style={{color: 'white', fontSize: 18}}>@react-spectrum</span>
      </Flex>
    </View>
    <View backgroundColor="green-600" height="size-900">
      <Flex alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" height="100%">
        <span style={{color: 'white', fontSize: 18}}>@react-aria</span>
      </Flex>
    </View>
    <View backgroundColor="blue-500" height="size-900">
      <Flex alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" height="100%">
        <span style={{color: 'white', fontSize: 18}}>@react-stately</span>
      </Flex>
    </View>
  </Flex>
</figure>

Our implementation of this architecture splits each piece into three npm
scopes, with individually versioned packages for each component. This
allows you **incrementally adopt** this approach in your own design system
and reuse as much or as little as makes sense for your usecases.

Within a component, the hooks are designed to be **highly composable**,
with individual features split into many hooks. This allows you to combine
them together and achieve your design with only the features you need in
your design system.

The overall goal for the project is to make reusing behavior across design
systems as easy as possible, while allowing full design customizability
and avoiding code bloat.

### React Stately

[React Stately](react-stately/index.html) implements state management and
core logic for each component. It handles complex logic for things
like [collections](react-stately/collections.html) and [selection](react-stately/selection.html)
in a fully cross-platform way that you could reuse on the web, in
react-native, etc.

React Stately hooks can be used independently in your own components,
or paired with React Aria hooks to get more of the behavior and user
interactions for web applications out of the box. We do not yet have
behavior hooks for other platforms however, so if you're working in
react-native or another view system, you'll need to use React Stately
directly.

Read more about React Stately and [get started](react-stately/getting-started.html)
by reading the docs.

### React Aria

[React Aria](react-aria/index.html) implements behavior and [accessibility](react-aria/accessibility.html)
for the web according to [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).
It includes full screen reader and keyboard navigation support, along with
mouse and touch [interactions](react-aria/interactions.html) that have been
tested across a wide variety of devices and browsers. It also implements
[internationalization](react-aria/internationalization.html) for over 30
languages, including right-to-left specific behavior, localized date and
number formatting, and more.

Most importantly, React Aria is **fully customizable**, since it doesn't
implement any rendering or impose a DOM structure or styling methodology.
You just need to spread the props returned by each React Aria hook onto
the appropriate DOM elements, and you get high quality interactions,
behavior, and accessibility pretty much for free. All you need to do is
provide the styling.

[Read more](react-aria/why.html) about React Aria and
the problems it solves, and check out the docs to [get started](react-aria/getting-started.html)
building your own design system.

### React Spectrum

[React Spectrum](react-spectrum/index.html) puts all of these pieces together
and implements the Adobe-specific styling. It's designed to be adaptive, and
works across mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions, on devices of any screen
size. It supports [theming](react-spectrum/theming.html), including automatic
support for dark mode and responsive scaling for large hit targets on touch
devices.

If you're integrating with Adobe software, React Spectrum is a great way to
make your UI consistent. It's also a really great example of how to use
React Aria and React Stately to build a full design system, so if you're
developing your own component library, you can check out the
[source code](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum) for
inspiration.
