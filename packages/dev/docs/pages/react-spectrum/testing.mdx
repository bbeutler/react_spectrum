# Testing

This page describes how to test an application built with with React Spectrum, including how to
query the DOM tree for elements and simulate user interactions.

## Introduction

Running automated tests on your application helps ensure that it continues to work as expected over time.
You can use testing tools like [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) or
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) along with test runners like
[Jest](https://jestjs.io) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) to test React Spectrum applications. These generally
work quite well out of the box but there are a few things to consider to ensure your tests are the best they
can be.

## Testing semantics

Many testing libraries expect you to query for elements in the DOM tree. For example, you might have a test
that renders a login page, finds the username and password fields, and simulates filling them out and
submitting the form.

Querying for these elements can be done in many ways. It's common to use CSS selectors for this,
but this can be problematic if you rely on implementation details of the component in these queries.
For example, if you query by a CSS class name that may change in a future update of React Spectrum, your
test will be brittle.

This also applies if you query for internal elements within a React Spectrum component. The DOM structure
that React Spectrum renders should be considered a black box, and it may change at any time, so you should
avoid relying on it.

The recommended way to query for React Spectrum components and their internals is by semantics. React Spectrum
components implement [ARIA patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/). ARIA is a W3C standard
that specifies the semantics for many UI components. This is used to expose them to assistive technology
such as screen readers, but can also be used in tests to operate the application programmatically. These semantics
are much less likely to change over time, and while other DOM nodes may be added or removed, and CSS classes
changed, the semantics are more likely to stay stable.

The main attribute to look for when querying is the [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques).
This attribute represents the type of element a DOM node represents, e.g. a button, list option, or tab.
This is similar to the HTML element type (e.g. `<button>` or `<option>`), but since many React Spectrum
components are implemented with `<div>` for styling purposes, the `role` attribute is used instead to
communicate the element's semantics.

### React Testing Library

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is useful because it
enforces that you write tests using semantics instead of implementation details. We use React Testing Library
to test React Spectrum itself, and it's quite easy to [query](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries)
elements by role, text, label, etc.

```tsx
import {render} from '@testing-library/react';

let tree = render(<MyComponent />);
let option = tree.getByRole('button');
```

### Enzyme

In Enzyme, you can [use CSS selectors](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/find.html) to find
elements. You can query by role using an attribute selector:

```tsx
import {mount} from 'enzyme';

let wrapper = mount(<MyComponent />);
let option = wrapper.find('[role="option"]');
```

## Test ids

Querying by semantics covers many scenarios, but what if you have many buttons on a page? How do you find the specific button
you're looking for in a test? In many cases this could be done by querying by the text in the button or an
accessibility label associated with it, but sometimes this might change over time or may be affected by things like
translations in different languages. In these cases, you may need a way to identify specific elements in tests, and that's
where test ids come in.

React Spectrum components pass all [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)
through to their underlying DOM nodes, which allows you to use an attribute like `data-testid` to identify
a particular instance of a component. For example, you could add test ids to the two input elements
in a login form and use them to find the username and password fields.

This example uses React Testing Library, but the idea could be applied in a similar way with Enzyme or other
testing libraries.

```tsx
import {render} from '@testing-library/react';
import {TextField} from '@react-spectrum/textfield';

function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <TextField label="Username" data-testid="username" />
      <TextField label="Password" data-testid="password" />
    </>
  );
}

let tree = render(<LoginForm />);
let username = tree.getByTestId('username');
let password = tree.getByTestId('password');
```

## Triggering events

Most testing libraries include a way to simulate events on an element. React Spectrum components rely on
many different browser events to support different devices and platforms, so it's important to simulate
these correctly in your tests. For example, rather than only simulating a click event, the tests should
simulate all of the events that would occur if a real user were interacting with the component.

For example, a click is really a `mousemove` and `mouseover` the target, followed
by `mousedown`, `focus`, and `mouseup` events, and finally a `click` event. If you only simulated the `click`
event, you would be missing all of these other preceding events that occur in real-world situations and this
may make your test not work correctly. The implementation of the component may also change in the future to
expect these events, making your test brittle. In addition, browsers have default behavior that occurs on
certain events which would be missing, like focusing elements on mouse down, and toggling checkboxes on click.

The best way to handle this is with the [user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) library.
This lets you trigger high level interactions like a user would, and the library handles firing all of the individual
events that make up that interaction. If you use this library rather than firing events manually, your tests
will simulate real-world behavior much better and work as expected.

user-event can handle many types of interactions, e.g. clicks, tabbing, typing, etc. This example shows how you could
use it to render a login form and enter text in each field and click the submit button, just as a real user would.

```tsx
import {render} from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

let tree = render(<LoginForm />);

// Click on the username field to focus it, and enter the value.
userEvent.click(tree.getByLabelText('Username'));
userEvent.type(document.activeElement, 'devon');

// Tab to the password field, and enter the value.
userEvent.tab();
userEvent.type(document.activeElement, 'Pas$w0rd');

// Tab to the submit button and click it.
userEvent.tab();
userEvent.click(document.activeElement);
```
