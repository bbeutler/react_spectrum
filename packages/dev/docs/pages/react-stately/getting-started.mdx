# Getting Started

This page describes how to get started building your own component library with React Stately.

## What is React Stately?

**React Stately** is library of React Hooks that provides cross-platform state management for your design system.
It provides the foundation and core logic for your component library, and implements state management for many
common components. It returns an interface for reading and updating component state, with methods that implement
much of the core logic for the component.

React Stately is designed to be cross-platform, and could work on the web, react-native, or any other platform.
On the web, it can be paired with [React Aria](../react-aria/index.html), which provides behavior, accessibility,
and user interactions for many components, while React Stately provides state management.

## Installation

React Stately is **incrementally adoptable**. Each component is published as a separate package, so you can try it
out in a single component and gradually add more over time. All of these packages are published under the
[@react-stately](https://www.npmjs.com/org/react-stately) scope on npm.

You can install any React Stately package using a package manager like [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or
[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

```
yarn add @react-stately/radio
```

We also offer a single package containing all React Stately hooks. See [below](#mono-package) for details.

## Building a component

This example shows a very simple radio group component built with the [useRadioGroupState](useRadioGroupState.html) hook
to manage state. It generates a name for each input in the group so the browser associates them, and manages the
selection state. The example shows [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) behavior
using the `defaultValue` prop, and `useRadioGroupState` handles firing the `onChange` event with the new selected value.

```tsx example
import {useRadioGroupState} from '@react-stately/radio';

function RadioGroup(props) {
  let state = useRadioGroupState(props);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="radio"
          name={state.name}
          checked={state.selectedValue === 'dogs'}
          onChange={() => state.setSelectedValue('dogs')} />
        Dogs
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="radio"
          name={state.name}
          checked={state.selectedValue === 'cats'}
          onChange={() => state.setSelectedValue('cats')} />
        Cats
      </label>
    </>
  );
}

<RadioGroup
  defaultValue="dogs"
  onChange={value => alert(`Selected ${value}`)} />
```

If you're using React Stately on the web, see [useRadioGroup](../react-aria/useRadioGroup.html) in React Aria to help
handle more of this behavior and accessibility for you. To see an example of how React Stately manages more complex state,
see [useSelectState](useSelectState.html).

## Mono-package

In addition to individual packages, we also offer a mono-package containing all of the React Stately hooks in a single
package. This ensures that all packages use compatible versions and are upgraded together. If you release all components
in your component library in a single package, or just want to get started easily without installing a lot of packages,
the mono-package may be the way to go. It is available as the [react-stately](https://npmjs.com/package/react-stately) package
on npm.

```
yarn add react-stately
```

Once installed, all hooks work the same way as the individual packages, but are imported from the `react-stately` package
instead of individual packages.

```tsx
// Individual packages
import {useRadioGroupState} from '@react-stately/radio';
```

```tsx
// Monopackage
import {useRadioGroupState} from 'react-stately';
```

## Next steps

Now that you understand how to use the hooks in React Stately to build your own components, you can read the documentation
for the individual hooks to understand them in detail. We also have high level documentation about more complex topics like
[collections](collections.html) and [selection](selection.html).

For more examples of using React Stately, also check out the docs for [React Aria](../react-aria/index.html), which is a library
of hooks that implement behavior and accessibility for the web on top of React Stately. For a complete example of a full component library
built with React Stately and React Aria, also check out [React Spectrum](../react-spectrum/index.html). The
[source code](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/%40react-spectrum)
is a good example of how the React Stately and React Aria hooks are used in many real-world components.
