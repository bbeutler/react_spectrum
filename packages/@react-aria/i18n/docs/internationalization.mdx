# Internationalization

Adapting components to respect languages and cultures of users around the world is an important way to help make your
application accessible to the widest number of people. React Aria supports over 30 languages, including
right-to-left mirroring and interactions.

## Introduction

Internationalization is the process of structuring your code and user interface to support localization. React Aria supports
many aspects of localization for many components out of the box, including translations for builtin strings, localized
date and number formatting, right-to-left interactions, and more. By using React Aria for your design system,
these aspects of internationalization are handled for you. You can also use our hooks in your own custom components.

## Localization

Localization is the process of adapting an application for a particular language or region. It includes translating text content,
as well as adapting date formatting, number formatting, collation and sorting, text search, and more.

React Aria includes translations for all builtin strings in over 30 locales. However, because React Aria provides no rendering,
most of the builtin strings are for non-visible content to provide accessible labels. All application provided content must be localized
and passed in to components. This can be done with libraries such as [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl).
Internally, React Aria uses the same [intl-messageformat](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat) library used by react-intl.

React Aria also formats, parses, and manipulates dates and numbers according to the user's preferred locale, and uses internationalized algorithms
for collation, sorting, and text search. This is built into all of the components that need to perform these tasks out of the box, but you can
also use our internationalization hooks in your own components. These are implemented with the builtin browser
[Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) APIs under the hood, so there's no
large libraries or locale data for users to download.

See [useMessageFormatter](useMessageFormatter.html), [useDateFormatter](useDateFormatter.html), [useNumberFormatter](useNumberFormatter.html),
and [useCollator](useCollator.html) for more information about using our internationalization hooks. The
[Internationalized](../../internationalized/index.html) collection of libraries provides framework-agnostic utilities for representing
and manipulating [dates and times](../../internationalized/date/index.html), and parsing and formatting
[numbers](../../internationalized/number/index.html) across many locales, calendar systems, numbering systems, and more.

## Bi-directionality

Many languages such as those written in the Latin script (e.g. English and French), Cyrillic script (e.g. Russian and Bulgarian), and
logographic scripts (e.g. Chinese and Japanese) are written left to right. Other languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are written
right to left. These languages are called “bi-directional,” or are also commonly referred to as “RTL” (“right-to-left”) languages.

In right-to-left languages, user interfaces are expected to be **mirrored**. Layouts flip such that components are positioned on the
opposite side of the interface. For example, a button that would be displayed on the right side of a screen in a left-to-right language
would appear on the left side of the screen in a right-to-left language. In addition, elements within a component are also expected to
mirror. For example, in a checkbox component, the label would be placed on the left side of the checkmark rather than the right.

Since React Aria provides no rendering, it is up to you to implement RTL support in your design. The documentation for individual react-aria hooks
calls out when you need to be aware of this, so you can account for it in your CSS using
[logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) or other means. For example, flexbox and CSS grid
both automatically flip their layouts depending on the direction.

Even though it is not responsible for rendering or layout, React Aria is aware of the current directionality, and adjusts interactions
accordingly. For example, when navigating using the left and right arrow keys, React Aria automatically flips the direction so that
the left arrow always navigates to the item physically to the left, and the right arrow always navigates to the item physically to the right.

## Example

The root most element of your application should define the [lang](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang)
and [dir](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) attributes so that the browser knows which language
and direction the user interface should be rendered in. This can be done with the [useLocale](useLocale.html) hook from `@react-aria/i18n`.

```tsx
import {useLocale} from '@react-aria/i18n';

function YourApp() {
  let {locale, direction} = useLocale();

  return (
    <div lang={locale} dir={direction}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

React Aria automatically detects the user's current language by default, and even updates this if the browser or system language changes.
However, if you would like to override this with an application specific setting, you can do so using the [I18nProvider](I18nProvider.html)
exposed by `@react-aria/i18n`.

```tsx
import {I18nProvider} from '@react-aria/i18n';

<I18nProvider locale="fr-FR">
  <YourApp />
</I18nProvider>
```

**Note:** if you are using server side rendering, you should always specify a locale rather than relying on browser defaults
to ensure that the server and client match. See the [SSR docs](ssr.html#locale-selection) for more information.
