## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useButton} links={docs.links} />

## Features

On the surface, building a custom styled button seems simple. However, there are many
cross browser inconsistencies in interactions and accessibility features to consider.
`useButton` handles all of these interactions for you, so you can focus on the styling.

* Native HTML `<button>` support
* `<a>` and custom element type support via ARIA
* Mouse and touch event handling, and press state management
* Keyboard focus management and cross browser normalization
* Keyboard event support for <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> and <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> keys

## Anatomy

Buttons consist of a clickable area usually containing a textual label or an icon
that users can click to perform an action. In addition, keyboard users may activate
buttons using the <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> or <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> keys.

If a visual label is not provided (e.g. an icon only button), then an `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` prop must be passed to identify the button to assistive technology.

## Example

By default, `useButton` assumes that you are using it with a native `<button>` element.

```tsx example
import {useButton} from '@react-aria/button';
import {useRef} from 'react';

function Button(props) {
  let ref = useRef();
  let {buttonProps} = useButton(props, ref);
  let {children} = props;

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>Test</Button>
```

## Custom element type

Sometimes you might need to use an element other than a native `<button>`. `useButton` supports
this via the `elementType` prop. When used with an element other than a native button, `useButton`
automatically applies the necessary ARIA roles and attributes to ensure that the element is exposed
to assistive technology as a button.

In addition, this example shows usage of the `isPressed` value returned by `useButton` to properly
style the button's active state. You could use the CSS `:active` pseudo class for this, but `isPressed`
properly handles when the user drags their pointer off of the button, along with keyboard support and better
touch screen support.

```tsx example
function Button(props) {
  let {children} = props;
  let ref = useRef();
  let {buttonProps, isPressed} = useButton({
    ...props,
    elementType: 'span'
  }, ref);

  return (
    <span
      {...buttonProps}
      style={{
        background: isPressed ? 'darkgreen' : 'green',
        color: 'white',
        padding: 10,
        cursor: 'pointer',
        userSelect: 'none',
        WebkitUserSelect: 'none'
      }}
      ref={ref}>
      {children}
    </span>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>Test</Button>
```
