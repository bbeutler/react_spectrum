## Introduction

Certain browser + screen reader combinations do not implement aria-modal correctly, which may unintentionally allow users to navigate outside of the modal.
`react-aria-modal` watches a container element for `aria-modal` nodes and hides the rest of the dom from screen readers with `aria-hidden` when one is open. See the [aria-hidden](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aria-hidden) package for more details.
Most of the time you do not need this, it should only be necessary if your app is not mounted at the root of the page.

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.watchModals} links={docs.links} />

## How to use
Include `@react-aria/aria-modal-polyfill` once in your application and call `watchModals` before any modals are rendered.
```
import {watchModals} from '@react-aria/aria-modal-polyfill';
watchModals();
```

By default, `@react-aria/aria-modal-polyfill` watches the document body, but you can also pass it a selector string if your modals are mounted in a different container.

```
watchModals('.my-modal-root');
```
