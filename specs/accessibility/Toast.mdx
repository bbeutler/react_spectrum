# Toast Accessibility Specification

## Overview

A [`Toast`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Toast) displays a brief temporary notification. Toasts are noticeable, but do not disrupt the user experience and do not require an action to be taken.

## WAI-ARIA Design Pattern

`Toast` implements the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Alert design pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alert).
An [alert](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alert) is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.
Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically announced by most screen readers, and in some operating systems, they may trigger an alert sound.
It is important to note that, at this time, screen readers do not inform users of alerts that are present on the page before page load completes.

Because alerts are intended to provide important and potentially time-sensitive information without interfering with the user's ability to continue working, it is crucial they do not affect keyboard focus. The [alert dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alertdialog) is designed for situations where interrupting work flow is necessary.

It is also important to, wherever possible, avoid designing alerts that disappear automatically. An alert that disappears too quickly can lead to failure to meet [WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#no-timing).

If a `Toast` is designed to disappear after a period of time, a good length of time to keep the message up is 5 seconds plus 1 extra second for every 120 words, rounding up. This is how fast the average American reads. That means the shortest default that should be used as a best practice is 6 seconds.[ยน](https://medium.com/@sheribyrnehaber/designing-toast-messages-for-accessibility-fb610ac364be#65bf)

Another critical design consideration is the frequency of interruption caused by alerts. Frequent interruptions inhibit usability for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, which makes meeting the requirements of [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#interruptions) more difficult.

Toasts render into a landmark region, labelled by default as "Notifications", so that a screen reader user can easily locate and review persistent Toast messages.
It is recommended to position the container landmark region at a consistent place in the application from page to page, for example as the first child of the Provider, so that a screen reader user can always find it there when looking for open Toast messages.

### Keyboard

`Toast` does not have any inherent keyboard interaction, but interactive descendants like the close button or action button should be included in the keyboard navigation order for the web page.

`Toast` should not disappear automatically, i.e. the timeout should pause or stop, when focus is on the close button or action button within it

As a separate issue, the container landmark region where Toasts render, should be keyboard accessible through an implementation of landmark navigation. A keyboard user should be able to cycle through available landmark regions in the page using `F6` or `Shift+F6` to reach the Toast container region.

### Roles, States, and Properties

- Each `Toast` element has a `role` of [`alert`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alert).

- Remove button should have `aria-label` prop with localized string, "Close".

- Optional status, image icons within for `Toast` variants should have `alt` prop with the localized string describing the variant, "Error", "Warning", "Success", or "Information".

- The container landmark region into which Toasts are rendered has `role` of [`region`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#region). By default, the container landmark region should be labelledy using the `aria-label` and a localized string, "Notifications".

## v2 Implementation details

In React Spectrum, [`Toast`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Toast) the following open PRs provide labelling for the landmark region into which Toasts are rendered, and navigation of landmark regions using the keyboard:
- [#495: Fix #494 [Accessibility] ToastContainer should be labelled landmark region](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/pull/495)
- [#549: Fix #537 [Accessibility] Provide mechanism for navigation to landmark regions](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/pull/549)

### Dependencies
- `Provider`
