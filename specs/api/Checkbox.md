# Checkbox and Switch

```typescript
interface CheckboxBase extends InputBase {
  children?: ReactNode, // pass in children to render label
  'aria-label'?: string, // if no children, aria-label is required

  defaultSelected?: boolean,
  isSelected?: boolean,
  onChange?: (isSelected: boolean) => void, //Possibly add native event as arg?

  /* Cannot use InputProps because value is a
  valid dom prop for input as well as checked */
  value?: string, // dom prop for input element
  name?: string,
  isEmphasized?: boolean
}

interface Checkbox extends CheckboxBase {
  isIndeterminate?: boolean
}

interface Switch extends CheckboxBase {}
```
